        Orion brings a fresh approach to Professional Recruiting – with
        strong emphasis on the word “professional”. We treat each recruiting
        opportunity as its own project. We develop a deep understanding of
        the job requirements and the type of personality that will be
        successful within the client’s direct team and the overall
        organization. At the same time, we constantly work to build
        relationships with candidates who represent the top people in their
        fields.
